          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>I am intrigued by how the internet works and how humans interact
          with computing devices to provide solutions to everyday problems. I am
          particularly interested in how these problems are broken down into
          smaller bits and creative resolutions are birthed. My goal is to be a
          creator of intuitive, interesting and impactful technology solutions
          working with a team of like minds. Over the past few months, this
          interest has led me on to 
          <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/">@LAMBDA</a> as a full stack web
          developer.</p>
          <p>During this period, I make use of HTML/CSS to structure a
          website, Java-script to add functionality, React to manage my
          application and Node JS and SQL to fire up site’s back-end. I work
          every day on different projects which are summed up into daily
          challenges and weekly sprints. At the end of every month I work
          remotely with a team of developers to develop web solutions to combat
          real life problems, this has to be done from scratch and completed
          within four days.</p>
          <p>I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges
          that are meaningful to me. Although my professional path has taken a
          few twists and turns — from a database manager at an audit firm to
          customer engagement to commercial banking — I've never stopped
          engaging my passion to help others and solve problems. Prior to
          joining Lambda, I had considerable work experience in banking and
          auditing. As a relationship manager leading a team of 5 to meet retail
          acquisition targets for a bank and also as a customer service
          personnel resolving customer complaints and providing information on
          requests. These two roles have sharpened my communication skills,
          fine-tuned my presentation experience and enhanced my leadership
          qualities.</p>
           UI/UX Figma design: I make use of figma to create
          prototypes and mock-ups for websites and apps. FRONT-END WEB
          DEVELOPMENT My current experience and skills in front-end include:
          HTML/CSS Bootstrap/ JavaScript development: bootstraping, refactoring,
          improving the structure, reliability, build setup; full integration of
          front-end development using tools like Webpack with features like
          automatic code reload, code minifications, multiple environments
          support, CI/CD, automated testing of accessibility, server-side render
          and visual snapshots, good sense of design and UX, huge experience in
          several JS ecosystems, by having used in the past many libraries like
          React, Redux, Redux-Observable, RxJS, jQuery BACK-END WEB DEVELOPMENT
          In back-end, my current stack is NodeJS. I make use of Node JS,
          Express and MySQL to craft Web Servers and build API’s for consumption
          by client-side applications. I used these skills to be in charge of
          building out the back-end API for projects. I am comfortable with: I
          have mastered: building RESTful Web APIs with Express and Node.js,
          Server-side Routing,Express Middleware splitting the back-end into
          separate domains and microservices, cooperation with APIs, remote data
          synchronizations, cloud servers, asynchronous workers, using different
          types of databases (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) dividing the
          servers into different machine nodes / docker containers; database
          sharding; load balancing, refactoring existing applications, by
          improving code readibility, separating concerns into separate
          functions/classes/modules, taking the business logic out from your
          request/response layer into separate modules (DDD), and moving the app
          architecture into an event-based one writing unit and e2e tests,
          client side authentication.
