<p>Bio
I am intrigued by how the internet works and how humans interact with computing devices to provide solutions to everyday problems. I am particularly interested in how these problems are broken down into smaller bits and creative resolutions are birthed. My goal is to be a creator of intuitive, interesting and impactful technology solutions working with a team of like minds.
Over the past few months, this interest has led me on to <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/">@LAMBDA</a>  as a full stack web developer. During this period, I make use of HTML/CSS to structure a website, Java-script to add functionality, React to manage my application and Node JS and SQL to fire up site’s back-end. I work every day on different projects which are summed up into daily challenges and weekly sprints. At the end of every month I work remotely with a team of developers to develop web solutions to combat real life problems, this has to be done from scratch and completed within four days. 
I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my professional path has taken a few twists and turns — from a database manager at an audit firm to customer engagement to commercial banking — I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.
Prior to joining Lambda, I had considerable work experience in banking and auditing. As a relationship manager leading a team of 5 to meet retail acquisition targets for a bank and also as a customer service personnel resolving customer complaints and providing information on requests. These two roles have sharpened my communication skills, fine-tuned my presentation experience and enhanced my leadership qualities.

FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPMENT
My current experience and skills in front-end include:
JavaScript development: bootstraping, refactoring, improving the structure, reliability, build setup;
full integration of front-end development using tools like Webpack with features like automatic code reload, code minifications, multiple environments support, CI/CD, automated testing of accessibility, server-side render and visual snapshots,
good sense of design and UX,
huge experience in several JS ecosystems, by having used in the past many libraries like React, Redux, Redux-Observable, RxJS, jQuery 
BACK-END WEB DEVELOPMENT
In back-end, my current stack is NodeJS. I make use of Node JS, Express and MySQL to craft Web Servers and build API’s for consumption by client-side applications. I used these skills to be in charge of building out the back-end API for projects.

I am comfortable with:

I have mastered:
building RESTful Web APIs with Express and Node.js, Server-side Routing,Express Middleware
splitting the back-end into separate domains and microservices,
cooperation with APIs, remote data synchronizations, cloud servers, asynchronous workers,
using different types of databases (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
dividing the servers into different machine nodes / docker containers; database sharding; load balancing,
refactoring existing applications, by improving code readibility, separating concerns into separate functions/classes/modules, taking the business logic out from your request/response layer into separate modules (DDD), and moving the app architecture into an event-based one
writing unit and e2e tests, client side authentication.
